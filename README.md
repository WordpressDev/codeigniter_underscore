======================

This is a simple demo to show that using a single join & an array function (in this case, one from Underscore.php - http://brianhaveri.github.com/Underscore.php/) is much faster than the approach of querying all top-level records and then foreach-ing over them and querying sub-records.

Benchmarking is not overly scientific, but I think it displays the point well enough
